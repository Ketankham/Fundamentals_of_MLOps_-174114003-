Part 1
1.  AIOps : It is defined as the multilayered platform that automates IT. It allows teams to increase the efficiency of IT infrastructure through the use of big data, data analytics,
2.  and machine learning algorithms. With the ever increasing amount of data generated today the automation of path from processes to production becomes important. Here the role of 
3.  Aiops becomes important which serves the above purpose. By the use of DevOps and data operations teams decide what to automate from development to production. Aiops is used to 
4.  detect anomalies. do root cause analysis,predict performance problems. Aiopps has two main components Big data and ML. 

Mlops :
It a multidisciplinary approach to manage machine learning algorithms. It aims to build,scale,and deploy ML algorithms consistently. So Mlops focuses on managing training testing data 
to create machine learning models efficiently and manage operations and pipelines
Hence Mlops bridges the gap between model building and environment. 
While Aiops focuses on determing and reacting to issues in IT operations and managing risks indepedently.

Question 2 :
Interpretability is defines as the extent to which a model can predict the results of a model. 
In linear regression the the target variable y is a function of the some variables x. 
The predicted outcome is function of weighted sum of its features. β(0)is the intercept and not multiplied by any feature. (ϵ) is defined as the error and is the difference 
between predicted and actual outcome by the model. The interpretation of weight in linear regression depends upon the type of the feature.
1. Numerical feature: Increase in this feature value increases the y by its weight.
2. Binary feature:Similar is for binary features
3. Categorical feature:
4. The intercept:
linear regression model can be interpreted by use of R square measurements. R square tells you how much of your total variance can be explained by the model.
Higher the value of R square better the model can explain the variations in the data.
